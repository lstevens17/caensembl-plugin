  <p><em>Caenorhabditis brenneri</em> is a small, free-living round worm found in decaying plant material throughout the tropics. The worms feed on the bacteria and other micro-organisms associated with plant decay. The biology of <em>C. brenneri</em> is similar to that of <em>C. elegans</em> with a short generation time through four larval stages into an adult. <em>C.brenneri</em> has both male and female adults, unlike the hermaphroditic species such as <em>C. elegans</em> and <em>C. briggsae</em>.
  <p><em>C. brenneri</em> was previously known as <em>Caenorhabditis</em> n. sp. 4 or PB2801 prior to the type description and renaming in 2007 (Sudhaus & Kiontke). The sequenced strain PB2801 was derived from a wild isolate LKC28, isolated by Hernan Ruiz from the roots of Liriope (Convallariaceae) in 2003, grown in an Costa Rican nursery. The wild isolate was inbred for 20 generations in the lab of Scott Baird by transferral of a single gravid female per generation.</p>
